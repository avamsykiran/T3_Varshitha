What is Java?
    is a high level strictly but partially object oriented programming language.

    + Strictly object oriented, as there is no way possible to implement any java application 
      without using OOP.
    + Partially object oriented, as java supports native variables and native types which are
      not objects and classes

Who developed Java?
    Sun microsystems - James Gosling
    Oracle corp. is the present owner of Java language.

            Microservices ...and more

        
        Java Micro Edition  (Java ME)
        ==================================
            supports smart device / smart card based application development.

    C/C++ program execution process:
    ---------------------------------
    text editor     -   source program  -                   sample.c / sample.cpp
    compiler        -   object program  -                   sample.obj / sample.o
                        (intermeditate program)
    linker          -   header files (.h)   -               sample.exe 
                        all the header files are linked 
                        to the object program and create
                        an executable program.
    loader          -   to supply the executable code to
                        the  O/S for execution.

    C/C++ languages are platform dependent languages. (here platform means o/s)

    Java program excution process:
    ------------------------------
    text editor             -   source code     -   sample.java
    compiler   (javac)      -   byte code       -   sample.class   
                        (byte code is not in the form of 0's & 1's)
    is this sample.class is targeted to one particular O/S ?
    NO.

    sample.class is not an executable program.

    byte code   --> JVM (Java Virtual Machine) -> JVM will convert the byte code 
        into native machine code (sequence of 0's & 1's understood by that particular
        O/S in which the program is executed)
        the program is executed.

        machine code is generated ON-THE-FLY.

    
    Java is platform (means o/s) independent language.

    is JDK  common for all O/S? -   (platform dependent)
    NO
    is JRE  common for all O/S? -   (platform dependent)
    No
    is JVM  common for all O/S? -   (platform dependent)
    NO

    BYTE CODE is the only one component which is platform independent.

    Features of Java:
    -----------------
    1. platform independent
    2. object oriented 
    3. secured
            no explicit pointers in java.
            java programs run inside a special environment i.e. JVM.
            JVM will talk to O/S.
    4. robust
            means fault-tolerant, strong, vigour and healthy.
            a. exception handling
            b. automatic garbage collection
            c. strong type checking.
    5. self-documented (open source)
        source code is visible to anyone.
    6. architectural neutral
    7. compiled and interpreted


Java Tokens
-----------
smallest element in the program.

1. identifier
        it is a name given to variables, class, method names, package etc.,

        variable, method names must follow camel notation 
            first word is in lowercase.
            from the second word onwards use first letter of each word is in uppercase
            and rest in lower case.

            eg:
                length

data types   
----------
    primitve types
        numeric 
            integral
                byte        1

                in java, true means not 1 and false means not 0.
                true, false are literals.

                void    
                    generally used to specify the return type of a function.

        interface
        enum

Scanner:  (java.util)
---------------------
    is used to accept data from the user into variables during runtime.

    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

    methods:
    --------
    nextInt()
    nextDouble()
    nextLong()
    next()          : to accept string (that contain only one word)
    nextLine()      : to accept string (that contain one or multiple words)

What is If?
    It is bi-directional decision making statement.

    if (condition)
        statement;
    [else
        statement;]

    if (condition) {
        statement-1;
        statement-2;
        ...
    } [else {
        statement-1;
        statement-2;
        ...
    }]

1. accept three numbers. print the biggest of these.
2. accept a number. print whether it is EVEN or ODD.
3. accept an year. print whether it is LEAP Year or Not.

                            year
                              |

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Switch?
    It is multi-directional decision making statement.

    switch (var/expr) {
        case label-1 : 
            statement-1;
            statement-2;
            [break;]
        case label-2 : 
            statement-1;
            statement-2;
            [break;]
        ...
        ...
        default:
            statement-1;
            statement-2;
            [break;]
    }

a) the var/expr must be int, char, string, enum type only.
b) label-1, label-2, ... are integer literals, character literals, string literals, enumerators.
c) comparisions must only be for equality.


4. accept two numbers and an arithmetic operator. perform the operation and print the result.
5. redo the program#4 using if statement.
6. accept a color code. print the corresponding color name.


Loop:
    set of statements that are executed repeatedly is called loop.
1) for
2) while
3) do..while

for:
----
    statement(s) in the for loop are executed repeatedly as long as the condition is TRUE.

    syntax:
                    (1)             (2)         (4)
            for(initialization; condition; update_expression) {
                statement-1;
                statement-2;        (3)
                ....
                [break;]
            }

    the for loop is used when we know how many times you want to execute statements.

7. print the first 'n' natural numbers.
8. print the first 'n' natural numbers in reverse order.
9. print the sum of first 'n' natural numbers.
10. print the sum of squares of first 'n' natural numbers.
11. print the factorial of 'n'.
        5! = 1x2x3x4x5
        3! = 1x2x3
12. print the multiplication table of a given number upto 10 terms.
        input : 6
        output :
            6 x 1 = 6
            6 x 2 = 12
            6 x 3 = 18
            ...
            6 x 10 = 60


Nested for loops:
-----------------
(for-within-for)

for loop -> repeat the inner for loop for certain no. of time
	for loop -> you are repeating certain statements
	
13. print the multiplication tables between two given numbers upto 10 terms.
	input : 
		first number : 5
		second number : 7

	output:
		5 x 1 = 5
		5 x 2 = 10
		...
		5 x 10 = 50

		6 x 1 = 6
		6 x 2 = 12
		..

15. print the following triangle upto 'n' rows.

	1
	1	2
	1	2	3
	1	2	3	4
	1	2	3	4	5


	one for loop to control number of rows.		(1 to n)
	another inner for loop to control number of columns in the current row.


	i = 1	=>	1 to 1
	i = 2	=>	1 to 2
	i = 3	=>	1 to 3
	
	  j     =>	1 to i

			for(int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
				System.out.print(j + "\t");	
			}	
			System.out.println();
		}
